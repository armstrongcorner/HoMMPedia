In addition, a group of Master Genie can only use blessing magic 3 times, but the number of times is limited! The magic cast by the Master Genie depends on the situation on the battlefield. They will not cast auxiliary magic that is useless to the battle. For example, if the opponent does not have a shooter, the air shield will not appear.

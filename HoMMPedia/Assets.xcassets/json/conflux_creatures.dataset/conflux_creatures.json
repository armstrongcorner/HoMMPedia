First of all, the basic growth rate of Phoenix is ​​2 per week, which is more than other level 7 troops. Moreover, they can also attack enemies within 2 squares like dragons. The speed is incredible, with Firebird's stats being 15 and Phoenix's stats being 21. Such good troops are very cheap, with the cost of 1500 and 2000 respectively. I am afraid that there is no more cost-effective troops than them.\n\nAs the fastest creature in HoMM3, it is what every magician wants to do to bring one to use magic on others and run away. If there are many, it is also a good idea to allocate one to induce the enemy's main force to counterattack. As for rebirth, I divided 1-15 (I think more are unlikely to appear in the battle) into six intervals of 1-4, 5, 6-9, 10, 11-14, and 15 for testing (Shadow of Death 3.0 version). I tested each interval 20 times and could only draw a general rule: 1-4, there may be no rebirth, and no more than one rebirth; 5, basically 1 rebirth; 6-9, at least 1, usually at most 2, but once in 20 times, 8 groups reborn 3; 10, basically 2 rebirths; 11-14, at least 2, usually at most 3, but once in 20 times, 14 groups reborn 4; 15, basically 3 rebirths. It can be seen that it is basically consistent with the 20% in the data, and there is a very rare chance that it will exceed 20%.\n\nFirebird/Phoenix is ​​not affected by Slayer magic! That is to say, troops with Slayer magic will not get the +8 attack when fighting Phoenix. (regardless of whether there is a Orb of Vulnerability or the level of Fire Magic). Firebird/Phoenix is ​​covered in fire, but its immunity to fire magic is not considered \"physiological immunity\", that is, the Orb of Vulnerability can remove its immunity. Similar situations also include Fire Elemental/Energy Elemental, Efreeti/Efreet Sultan, and Magic Elemental, which are also covered in fire.",

			"desc": "At first glance, the stats of Firebird and Phoenix are very average, but we must not underestimate their power. First of all, the basic growth rate of Phoenix is ​​2 per week, which is more than other level 7 troops. Moreover, they can also attack enemies within 2 squares like dragons. The speed is incredible, with Firebird's stats being 15 and Phoenix's stats being 21. Such good troops are very cheap, with the cost of 1500 and 2000 respectively. I am afraid that there is no more cost-effective troops than them.\n\nAs the fastest creature in HoMM3, it is what every magician wants to do to bring one to use magic on others and run away. If there are many, it is also a good idea to allocate one to induce the enemy's main force to counterattack. As for rebirth, I divided 1-15 (I think more are unlikely to appear in the battle) into six intervals of 1-4, 5, 6-9, 10, 11-14, and 15 for testing (Shadow of Death 3.0 version). I tested each interval 20 times and could only draw a general rule: 1-4, there may be no rebirth, and no more than one rebirth; 5, basically 1 rebirth; 6-9, at least 1, usually at most 2, but once in 20 times, 8 groups reborn 3; 10, basically 2 rebirths; 11-14, at least 2, usually at most 3, but once in 20 times, 14 groups reborn 4; 15, basically 3 rebirths. It can be seen that it is basically consistent with the 20% in the data, and there is a very rare chance that it will exceed 20%.\n\nFirebird/Phoenix is ​​not affected by Slayer magic! That is to say, troops with Slayer magic will not get the +8 attack when fighting Phoenix. (regardless of whether there is a Orb of Vulnerability or the level of Fire Magic). Firebird/Phoenix is ​​covered in fire, but its immunity to fire magic is not considered \"physiological immunity\", that is, the Orb of Vulnerability can remove its immunity. Similar situations also include Fire Elemental/Energy Elemental, Efreeti/Efreet Sultan, and Magic Elemental, which are also covered in fire.",

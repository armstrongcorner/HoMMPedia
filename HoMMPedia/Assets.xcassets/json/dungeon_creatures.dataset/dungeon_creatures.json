First of all, they have very few ammunitions and it is easy to run out of them in battle. Secondly, their melee attacks are not halved, which provides a prerequisite for them to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Finally, Medusa's classic ability is to petrify the enemy for three rounds when attacking. This is a special skill as useful as blindness.
